## Initial Proposal

**Workshop Title:** Canada's Contributions to Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence

**Background:** 
In the field of artificial intelligence, the term "deep learning" has gained massive popularity in recent years.
Companies such as Google have used the technique to great effect in image recognition, voice recognition, and even in audio/music generation.
To the extent that these technical capabilities will change the landscape for information professionals in technological, social, and cultural ways, it will be important to consider how Canada has helped advance this field.
The recent advances in deep learning field would not have been possible without the significant contributions by computer scientists in Canada, such as Professor Geoffrey Hinton of the University of Toronto and Yoshua Bengio of the Université de Montréal.
This workshop will present how Canadian researchers have pushed the state of the art in deep learning and artificial intelligence research.

**Outline:**
This workshop will provide an overview of the history and development of the deep learning field, with an emphasis on how Canadian researchers’ contributions have shaped the field.
Particular emphasis will be given to highlight the work of Professor Hinton of the University of Toronto and other Canadian contributors.
Next, the workshop will feature a demonstration of deep learning techniques using the TensorFlow Python library open sourced by Google.
As an introduction to the technology, the demonstration will show how deep learning techniques can decipher handwritten numbers.
Depending on time constraints, a further demonstration will show how current APIs perform in such tasks as image recognition, speech recognition, and translation.
